**Re-read the Gerson paper on Analyzing Interview Data.** 

1. You don't get to determine what the codes are before hand (but see(3)). You have to work out what they are in the process of coding the literature.
2. The goal of You have to keep going over the stuff and working out new codes, and over time the frequency of new codes drops over time, and then when they stop coming you know you're done, or almost done. But never quite, but rapidly you get to the point where there's diminishing returns.
3. You've been studying this stuff for years already, so a number of codes should have jumped out already. 
4. You have a lot of codes already that are specific to the literature that you've been working in. In order to get codes that are more general to the modeling literature you will have to do some comparative analysis **of the codes you have already developed** and then abstract the general category/code by noticing regularities and generalizing them.
5. Jim [[1/22/16 Meeting with Jim Griesemer re: NSF STS RSK proposal]] has already worked up some codes that are adaptations of Morgan and Cartwright: they have ladders and bridges, and Jim is adding public-ation. That is a complication and enrichment of the Morgan/Cartright model. And it forces you to revisit the Morgan/Cartwright
6. e.g. hypothesis #1 the publication process complicates the desituation/resituation process in the following ways
7. hypothesis 1.a this is one of the things we know about how publication complicates resituation (i.e. what) hypotheses 1.b etc.
8. There are already the notions of register and address from Elih's ISH paper. They should help you get started.
9. So, this allows you research question to be framed in the form of a hypothesis. Or a series of hypotheses. 

**Elih says:** to his knowledge, no one has talked in a systematic way about scientists reading literature. Elih goes to the lab's journal reading club every week. And it's an important institutional arrangement. And nobody in science studies is talking about it. (Though there is a literature in Literary studies and anthropology about reading groups. Probably in sociology as well?) The reading group is a public whose topic of conversation is the parts of the current scientific literature that the members find relevant. **That's a point that should be made, because it's not covered by the existing literatures on science**  The arrangements and goings-on of the lab reading group is an important part of the resituation process. And we want to explicitly look at this process.

**Another ar angeemnt**: One student from the lab is assigned (or assigns themselves in consultation with the PI) a paper or papers that seems interesting and gives a long structures presentation on that literature. It can be a 2 hour review of the literature. One paper. Or a few. And then the lab members engage in disputation and argument and think about what the competition is up to and whether their techniques are any good and should they be paid attention to. And that's part of the resituation process, too. SO resituation is at least two layers deep. At least. 

A motivation for this research program is: we are saying "show me" to a whole tradition of history and sociology of science that looks at the influence of different factors on scholarship. And we think yes that's true, there are these influences, but we are interested in HOW SPECIFICALLY that influence goes on. This is an important problem, and we know it's important because we've been talking about it for year but we don't know how it happens very clearly. 

**Studying the publication process**, including reading groups and journal clubs and lab literature reviews is concrete enough that the referees can get there head around when they're tired. Get this in the front. Because it is understandable in plain language and they can see how it will have some kind of payoff that will be interesting.
