###Xref prospective codes.  [[1/24/16 Meeting with Elih Gerson]]

The publication process entails making research outputs of various kinds available for others to use. Following Morgan (2014) and Cartwright (2012) we characterize propagating results as having three parts. First, research outputs are desituated in some way. Second, the outputs must be moved to a new site. Third, outputs are taken up by new workflows, thus becoming inputs for someone else. Each of these steps can employ diverse methods for desituating, transferring, and resituating. Morgan describes three genres of resituation strategies: stepping stones, ladders and bridges, and exemplars. In Morgan's account each of these contain steps for desituating, transferring, and resituating. 

We propose to enrich this picture through two revisions to Morgan's schema. First, we characterize Morgan's strategies of resituation in more specific and concrete ways. We call these tactics of resituation, in the sense that tactics is the theory of engagements, whereas strategy is the theory of the use of tactics to achieve political ends. **[NB this is a metaphor derived from the study of war fighting and we can take it out if it has bad connotations for anyone]**

Second, we will explain the phenomenon of resituation more comprehensively by adding an additional dimension to the picture: institutions. Tracking the institutions of resituation will **answer these important questions**

We will construct a database which will code the diverse tactics of resituation according to a developing schema. There are already a handful of classificatory concepts available for coding. These include Cartwright's notions of ladders of abstraction, and horizontal and vertical search. Others are Morgan's generic strategies, and Gerson's (2015) notions of *registering* findings to a new situation, and *addressing* problems of adapting to new workflows. We will develop new codes and refine the existing ones as we continue our ethnographic, archival, and literature research.
